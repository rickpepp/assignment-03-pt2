# Project Assignment: Distributed Agar.io Implementation

## Game Overview
Agar.io is a popular multiplayer online game where players control a circular cell in a 2D environment (see Wikipedia). The primary goal is to grow larger by consuming two types of entities:
1. Food Pellets: Small, static, randomly scattered pellets that increase a player's mass when consumed.
2. Other Player Cells: Players can consume other, smaller player cells.

Starting from this current solution (which is a centralized version of Agar.io), you will extend it to create a distributed version.

## Requirements
- The game is always active: players can join at any time and immediately start playing.
- Players can be located on different nodes and must be able to join or leave dynamically (distributed player management). 
  - Each player should have their own LocalView
        
- When a player consumes food, that food must be removed for all players in the system (distributed food management).
      
- Every player must have a consistent view of the world, including the positions of all players and food (consistent world view).
          
  - No player should see another player or food that is not visible to others.
          
  - No two players should see the same food in different positions.
      
- Food is generated randomly and distributed across nodes, and new food must be visible to all players (distributed food generation).
      
- The game ends when a player reaches a specific mass (e.g., 1000 units), and this end condition must be checked and enforced in a distributed way for all players (distributed game end condition).


## Implementation Hints
Try to reuse as much of the existing code as possible, especially the game logic. You should focus in how to generate the GameStateManager in a way that it can be distributed across nodes. In this way, you can reuse the also existing Views (local and global).

## Final Considerations

Justify each architectural choice by explaining how it impacts the system's reliability, responsiveness, and maintainability. Strive for a solution where actors collaborate to maintain a consistent world view without unnecessary centralization.
